Q: The description of the project to create is found in app-description.md. Don't write any code yet. Do you have any clarifying questions about this app-description document, or does it seem clear enough?

A:

The project requirements are quite clear and well-documented. The key aspects are well defined, including:

Technical stack and setup:

Vite + React + TypeScript
Express backend for OpenAI integration
Local storage for data persistence
Environment variables configuration
Data flow and API integration:

Edelweiss API endpoints and data structures
TypeScript interfaces for all data types
React Query for data fetching
OpenAI integration for marketing text generation
User flow and features:

Three-step process for document creation
SKU validation
Review selection
AI-generated marketing text
PDF generation and download
The only minor point that might need clarification is the styling requirements for the PDF output - while we know what content should be included, specific layout preferences (fonts, spacing, branding elements) aren't detailed. However, this isn't blocking as we can implement a clean, professional design and adjust based on feedback.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the application?
